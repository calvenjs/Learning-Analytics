# Learning-Analytics Predictive Analytics Module Final Project

##Project Overview
In Portugal, the student failure and dropping out rates remains high in Europe. The failure in the core classes of Mathematics and Portuguese is important and severe as it will affect their other remaining subjects. Hence, there is a compelling need to enhance the learning of these two subjects. With the help of Learning Analytics, educators can predict these students’ performance on the two subjects, provide them with personalized learning experience and increase retention rate. Hence, a roll out of collecting students’ data is implemented. The data were collected from school reports based on paper sheets and questionnaires were designed with closed questions for students to answer. The questions were reviewed by school professionals and tested on 15 students for feedback. The questionnaire was later modified to contain 37 questions in a single A4 sheet.
This project aims to predict student's achievement and identify key factors that affect education success or failure for the two core subjects; math and portuguese.

##Data Source
The dataset is a public data provided by Paulo Cortex and Alice Silva from University of Minho in Portugal. Paulo Cortex is an associate professor of Information Systems and a coordinator of the research group of Algorithmi Research Centre in the University. Algorithmi is a research unit that develops R&D activity in Information and Communications Technology and Electronics. They focus its activities that explore a strong link with the community, namely public administration. Data is dated back in 2005 and 2006, and contains student grades, demographics, social and school-releated features.
The data used for the models will not include past evaluations (G1, G2) to predict their final grade (G3) in order to identify other features other than past grades that may affect G3.
